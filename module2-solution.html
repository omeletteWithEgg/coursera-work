When Gentlemen can seeâ€”
But Microscopes are prudent
In an Emergency. </article>

			<h2>"In White"</h2>
			<article>A dented spider like a snow drop white
On a white Heal-all, holding up a moth
Like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
Saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
Portent in little, assorted death and blight
Like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
The beady spider, the flower like a froth,
And the moth carried like a paper kite.

What had that flower to do with being white,
The blue prunella every child's delight.
What brought the kindred spider to that height?
(Make we no thesis of the miller's plight.)
What but design of darkness and of night?
Design, design! Do I use the word aright?</article>

			<h2>It Was Wrong To Do This</h2>
			<article>"It was wrong to do this," said the angel. 
"You should live like a flower, 
Holding malice like a puppy, 
Waging war like a lambkin." 

"Not so," quoth the man 
Who had no fear of spirits; 
"It is only wrong for angels 
Who can live like the flowers, 
Holding malice like the puppies, 
Waging war like the lambkins." </article>
